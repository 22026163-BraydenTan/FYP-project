        <p>Proposed a Full-Stack application to solve Sustainability issues and implement DevOps release management based on the following requirements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Selection and usage of Gitpod, CodeSpaces, Code-Server and VSCode as an integrated development environment and CoPilot for AI-based code completion.</li>
            <li>Usage of a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. Integrated with the IDE to detect changes in the code.</li>
            <li>Jira and GitHub Integration to provide better traceability between Planning, Requirement, Code, Build, and Test Execution.</li>
            <li>Implement Cucumber and Gherkin to add Test Plan and Test Cases to a specific story in Jira.</li>
            <li>Test results will be uploaded back to Jira to provide the Requirement Traceability Matrix.</li>
            <li>Implement Feature-Driven Development to enhance developer experience and reduce time to develop new features, enabling tasks to be performed in the Cloud IDE.</li>
            <li>Implementation of End-to-End CI/CD release workflow using GitHub Actions, including continuous deployment by pushing the Docker image to a Docker registry (Docker Hub).</li>
            <li>Inspect the code using SonarQube and enable the Quality Gate Check-in CI/CD workflow.</li>
            <li>Detailed explanations together with relevant remediation for each of the identified vulnerabilities. The scan result should show reduced vulnerabilities after the mitigation.</li>
            <li>Release Management, including workflow diagram, version creation, task assignments, tracking releases, branch and PR creation, build, deployment, test, evidence capture, and reporting.</li>
        </ol>
